# Random Password Generator

## Description

The project represents an application that a user can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code.

The user is prompted to select:

- Length of password between 8 and 128 characters
- Use of special characters
- Use of numeric characters
- Use of lowercase characters
- User of uppercase characters

The code validates for each input and alerts the user when no character type was selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the password is generated and written to the page.
